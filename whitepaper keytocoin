KeytoCoin (KTC)
Bitcoin-Anchored Layer-2 Digital Diamond
Abstract
KeytoCoin (KTC) is a Bitcoin-anchored Layer-2 execution blockchain that uses Bitcoin as its ultimate layer of trust. With a maximum supply capped at 17 million units, KeytoCoin is designed as a digital diamond: a scarce, durable, and cryptographically verifiable asset secured through Bitcoin. The system preserves decentralization, an independent proof-of-work consensus, and its own peer-to-peer network, while aligning with the modern Bitcoin Layer-2 ecosystem.
1. Background
Bitcoin is the most secure and decentralized network in the world, yet it is not designed to host complex application logic directly. For this reason, Layer-2 solutions have emerged to extend Bitcoin’s functionality without compromising its security.
KeytoCoin operates as an independent execution layer Layer-2, using a state anchoring approach to Bitcoin. This design aligns with Bitcoin’s core philosophy: minimalism, verifiability, and long-term resilience.
2. Objectives of KeytoCoin
To serve as a scarce digital asset with a limited supply (17 million units)
To provide an alternative long-term store of value
To utilize Bitcoin as the settlement and finality layer
To represent a “digital diamond” within the crypto ecosystem
3. System Architecture
3.1 Layer 1: Bitcoin
Bitcoin functions as:
The finality layer
A storage medium for KeytoCoin state commitments
A global source of cryptographic trust
KeytoCoin does not modify Bitcoin. Instead, it leverages Bitcoin transactions (such as OP_RETURN) to record cryptographic hashes of the KeytoCoin network state.
3.2 Layer 2: KeytoCoin Execution Layer
KeytoCoin maintains:
An independent blockchain
Proof-of-Work consensus
Peer-to-peer nodes
Wallets and an internal balance system
Each block reflects a state transition within the KeytoCoin network.
4. State Commitment Mechanism
At defined intervals, the KeytoCoin network summarizes its current state into a cryptographic state commitment hash that includes:
Block height
Total circulating supply
Balance distribution
This hash is then recorded on the Bitcoin network. As a result, every KeytoCoin state transition can be independently verified against Bitcoin.
5. Bitcoin Anchor Block
KeytoCoin introduces a special block type:
BTC_ANCHOR Block
Contains the KeytoCoin state hash
References a Bitcoin transaction ID (TXID)
Does not modify supply or balances
This block acts as a cryptographic bridge between KeytoCoin and Bitcoin.
6. Bitcoin Lock Model (Proof-of-Lock)
KeytoCoin supports recording proofs of Bitcoin locking:
Users lock BTC on the Bitcoin network
The corresponding TXID is recorded on KeytoCoin
The KeytoCoin network never takes custody of BTC
This model aligns with the RGB protocol and client-side validation approach.
7. Token Economics
Name: KeytoCoin (KTC)
Maximum Supply: 17,000,000 KTC
Inflation: Zero after the maximum supply is reached
Distribution: Proof-of-Work mining
There is no premine, no manual minting, and no unilateral modification of the supply.
8. Security & Decentralization
Independent Proof-of-Work consensus
Layered hash verification (KeytoCoin + Bitcoin)
A permissionless peer-to-peer network
Bitcoin serves as a trust amplifier, not as a controller of the KeytoCoin network.
9. Position Within the Bitcoin Layer-2 Ecosystem
Conceptually, KeytoCoin aligns with:
Bitcoin Rollups (state commitment model)
RGB Protocol (client-side validation)
Anchored sidechain architectures
However, KeytoCoin focuses on value storage rather than complex smart contract execution.
10. Long-Term Vision
KeytoCoin does not aim to replace Bitcoin, but to complement it. With a strictly limited supply and Bitcoin anchoring, KeytoCoin is designed to serve as a long-term store of value that remains verifiable across generations.
Conclusion
KeytoCoin is a serious experiment in building a scarce digital asset rooted in Bitcoin’s security. Through a simple yet robust Layer-2 architecture, KeytoCoin positions itself as a digital diamond in the decentralized economic era.
